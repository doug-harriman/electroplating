# Materials

* Acetone thinned copper laquer spray.
* Conductive wire for holding print
  * Copper - Cheaper
  * Silver - Won't oxidize as quickly  
* Nickel electrode
* Power supply
* Distilled Vinegar
* Pickling Salt - No additives
* Filter covering for anodes - Plates will disolve, fouling bath with contaminents from metal impurities over time.
  * Non-woven polypropylene   
  * [Pond filter pad](https://www.amazon.com/Polishing-Filter-Pad-100-Micron/dp/B014G7WTRY/) and hot glue to make pocket.  
* Rotation Mechanism
  * Just let wire slip in wire clamp jaws. 
* Container for bath
* Sandpaper
* Fine steel wool

# Notes

* Per Hen3drik: Surface area of electrodes should be slightly greater than surface area of item to be plated. 
  * Blender can calculate surface area of you don't have it from your ME CAD software.  
  * Would be good to find calculations on surface areas, current, time.
* Run at currents just below bubbling point.   
* Rotation should be very slow.
* If you use a wire wrap, print must be moved often to avoid welding the wire to the print.  If the part can have a hidden tab, that can be cut off, this issue can be avoided.
